## Star Citizen - Fleet Info

This code injects a new sub page in the account section of https://robertsspaceindustries.com
On this page, all vehicles contained in packages are displayed with some info.

## Status

WIP prototype, so it's quite dirty. Expect bugs.

## How to use

There is no dedicated browser extension yet.

Best way is to use any script injection plugin for your browser and inject the 
contents of fleetInfo.js on "https://robertsspaceindustries.com/account" and its sub pages.

I use [https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/codeinjector](https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/codeinjector)
([https://github.com/Lor-Saba/Code-Injector](https://github.com/Lor-Saba/Code-Injector))

It's also available for Chrome.
